\section{Discussions and Conclusions} \label{sec:disc}
In this paper, we propose an adaptive mixture modeling approach to
construct importance function for IS. The resulting mixture model is
demonstrated to be capable of capturing separated peaky structures
in the posterior, even when it is high-dimensional (an at most
17-dimensional posterior is considered in this paper).
Straightforwardly, this approach facilitates simulating draws from
multi-modal joint posterior distribution by IS, and provides an
effective and easy-to-implement way for estimating marginal
likelihood that is required for Bayesian model comparison.
